# DeepDixit

This is a game that leverages the weirdness of the images generated by CLIP.

The idea is that since the images generated are quite abstract and hard to decipher,
it makes a fun game to try and guess the prompt that originally led the neural network
to generate the image.

### Running locally

1. Add an environment variable `DATABASE_URI` with the connection string from the Heroku Postgres Database. Make sure to change the `postgres://...` at the beginning to `postgresql://...`
2. Run `python wsgi.py` from the root of this repository to start the Flask server.


## Instructions for TA

- For the web scraping scripts, look [here](data_gathering/scrapers)
- For the website components, see the [app](app) directory
- For notebooks that perform image generations, check out the [original](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FoHdqoqKntliaQKnMoNs3yn5EALqWtvP) [notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NCceX2mbiKOSlAd_o7IU7nA9UskKN5WR?usp=sharing) by Ryan Murdock. (we use [two](https://github.com/lucidrains/deep-daze) [modules](https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep) that build around the models from those notebooks)
- To see the parameters we are using to perform image generation, see [`gendata.py`](gendata.py)
- Each feature that we are currently working on has its own branch, these can be explored too.
