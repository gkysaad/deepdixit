This is a game that leverages the weirdness of the images generated by CLIP.

The idea is that since the images generated are quite abstract and hard to decipher,
it makes a fun game to try and guess the prompt that originally led the neural network
to generate the image.

### Running locally

1. Add an environment variable `DATABASE_URL` with the connection string from the Heroku Postgres Database. Make sure to change the `postgres://...` at the beginning to `postgresql://...`


## Instructions for TA

- For the web scraping scripts, look [here](https://github.com/nshdesai/papersforbabies/tree/main/data_gathering/scrapers)
- For the website components, see the [app](https://github.com/nshdesai/papersforbabies/tree/main/app) directory
- For notebooks that perform image generations, check out the [original](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FoHdqoqKntliaQKnMoNs3yn5EALqWtvP) [notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NCceX2mbiKOSlAd_o7IU7nA9UskKN5WR?usp=sharing) by Ryan Murdock. (we use [two](https://github.com/lucidrains/deep-daze) [modules](https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep) that build around the models from those notebooks)
- To see the parameters we are using to perform image generation, see the [`gendata.py`](https://github.com/nshdesai/papersforbabies/blob/generate_images/gendata.py) under [`generate_images`](https://github.com/nshdesai/papersforbabies/tree/generate_images)
- Each feature that we are currently working on has its own branch, these can be explored too.
